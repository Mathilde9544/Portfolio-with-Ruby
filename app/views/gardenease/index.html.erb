    <h1>GardenEase</h1>
    <p class="ge-text">GardenEase is a website for people who would like
      to start gardening at their place, but don't know how to start.<br/>
      By understanding your preferences and home environment, GardenEase
      provides tailored gardening projects with step-by-step care advices.<br/>
      GardenEase was built during the 2 last weeks of the bootcamp. We were a group of 3 students.
    </p>
    <h4 class="ge-parts">How does it work ?</h4>
    <p class="ge-text">GardenEase asks you to define some criterias regarding
      the place your live, to be able to generate gardening projects that will be
      working at your place and location: do you live in a shady flat ? Do you plan to
      put the plant in a humid part of the house ? Do you expect flours ? Cooking herbs ? etc.<br/>
      A promt with your answers is sent to ChatGPT. It will then generate a strctured answer
      that will then be restructured in the HTML.
